DS Auto Insights Advanced Features Implementation Plan
========================================================

Based on the capability gap analysis, this document outlines the strategic plan to implement
advanced statistical, ML, and data cleaning features to match and exceed ChatGPT's analysis capabilities.

CURRENT POSITION ASSESSMENT
===========================
âœ… Strengths (Already at 90% EDA parity):
- Dataset introspection: schema, previews, sample rows
- Descriptive stats: column describe, groupby + aggregation, top categories
- Distributions: histograms (numeric), bar charts (categorical)
- Correlations: correlation matrix, correlation heatmap
- Scatter/line/time series plots: dedicated chart tools
- Data transformations: create new columns safely
- Narrative explanations: narrative_explain functionality
- Safety controls: whitelisted pandas operations, read-only default

STRATEGIC COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
================================
ðŸŽ¯ Key Differentiators to Implement:
1. **Data Cleaning Suite** - ChatGPT doesn't offer systematic data cleaning
2. **PM-Focused ML Tools** - Interpretable models with business context
3. **Statistical Rigor** - Proper hypothesis testing and significance
4. **Comprehensive Evaluation** - Model diagnostics and validation
5. **Organic AI Suggestions** - Context-aware recommendations

IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
======================

Week 1: Core Cleaning Tools
- analyze_missing_data() - Patterns and visualization heatmaps
- impute_missing_values() - Multiple strategies (mean/median/mode/forward-fill)
- detect_outliers() - IQR method, Z-score, isolation forest
- remove_outliers() - Safe outlier handling with impact analysis

Week 2: Data Quality & Validation
- find_duplicates() - Smart duplicate detection and handling
- optimize_data_types() - Auto-detect and convert types
- validate_data_quality() - Range checks, consistency validation
- standardize_normalize_data() - Scaling and normalization for ML

Key Features That Beat ChatGPT:
â€¢ Missing Data Analysis: Pattern visualization, correlation analysis
â€¢ Outlier Detection: Multiple methods with before/after comparisons
â€¢ Data Quality Reports: Automated profiling with quality scores
â€¢ Smart Type Detection: Auto-detect dates, categories, handle mixed types

PHASE 2: CORE STATISTICAL FOUNDATION (Week 3)
---------------------------------------------
Essential statistical tests for PM decision-making:

- run_t_test() - One-sample, two-sample, paired t-tests
- run_z_test() - One-sample, two-sample, paired z-tests

Focus: Main statistical tests that cover 80% of PM needs

PHASE 3: ESSENTIAL ML MODELS (Week 4-6)
---------------------------------------
Core models prioritized for PM use cases:

Week 4: Linear Regression Foundation
- fit_linear_regression() - Simple and multiple regression
- fit_logistic_regression() - Binary and multiclass classification

*Establishes ML evaluation patterns and interpretability*

Week 5: Random Forest + Feature Importance
- fit_random_forest() - Classification and regression variants
- calculate_feature_importance() - Variable importance plots and rankings
*High-value for PM insights - what factors matter most?*

Week 6: Advanced Models
- fit_pca_analysis() - Dimensionality reduction and exploration
- fit_time_series_model() - Forecasting with ARIMA/seasonal decomposition
- fit_survival_model() - Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier (if relevant)

PHASE 4: MODEL EVALUATION FRAMEWORK (Week 7)
--------------------------------------------
Comprehensive model assessment:

- evaluate_classification_model() - Accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix
- plot_model_diagnostics() - Residual plots, ROC curves, learning curves
- cross_validation_analysis() - Proper train/test splits, k-fold CV
- feature_importance_analysis() - For all applicable models

DEPENDENCIES TO ADD
------------------
pyproject.toml additions:

Note: Data cleaning requires no additional dependencies - pandas handles most operations!

ORGANIC AI SUGGESTIONS STRATEGY
===============================

Context-Aware Recommendations:
------------------------------
The AI should naturally suggest appropriate analyses based on:

Data Characteristics Detected:
â€¢ High missing data â†’ "I notice 30% missing values in salary column. Should I analyze missing data patterns?"
â€¢ Potential outliers â†’ "There are extreme values in price data. Would you like me to check for outliers?"
â€¢ Data type issues â†’ "The date column is stored as text. Should I convert it to proper datetime format?"
â€¢ Duplicates â†’ "I found 15 duplicate rows. Would you like to see them and decide how to handle them?"

User Questions Patterns:
â€¢ "predict" â†’ Suggest regression or classification models
â€¢ "forecast" â†’ Recommend time series analysis
â€¢ "what factors influence" â†’ Propose feature importance analysis
â€¢ "segment customers" â†’ Suggest clustering or classification

Context Awareness:
â€¢ After EDA â†’ Suggest modeling opportunities
â€¢ After correlation analysis â†’ Recommend regression
â€¢ After data cleaning â†’ Propose advanced analytics
â€¢ After initial model â†’ Suggest evaluation and diagnostics

DESIGN PRINCIPLES
