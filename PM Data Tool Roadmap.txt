PART 1: 4-WEEK PROTOTYPE ROADMAP
🔧 Objective
Build a functioning prototype of your MCP-driven data science tool. It should:
* Accept a product spec as natural language input

* Allow upload of arbitrary datasets

* Let the user ask questions (e.g., "show churn predictors")

* Return interactive dashboards or summaries with EDA/ML insights

* Work end-to-end for 2–3 use cases

________________


🗓️ Week-by-Week Plan
Week 1 — Setup & Data Handling
Goals:
   * Backend skeleton with FastAPI (or Streamlit for full-stack simplicity)

   * Upload and parse dataset (CSV/XLSX)

   * Accept product spec and extract context

Tasks:
      * Set up repo + Python env (Poetry or Conda)

      * Build endpoint to upload datasets → store in Pandas

      * Accept product spec via text box

      * Use GPT to extract goals/KPIs from the spec

      * Store metadata for dataset + context in session

Deliverables:
         * Local app that loads data and parses product spec

         * Sample printout: {goal: 'reduce churn', kpis: ['retention rate']}

Week 2 — Natural Language → Task Conversion
Goals:
            * Convert natural language queries to EDA/ML tasks

            * Start with simple intent classification (manually or via GPT)

            * Build dispatcher functions (EDA, classify, cluster)

Tasks:
               * Implement prompt classifier ("show churn predictors" → "classification")

               * Build core analytics functions:

                  * generate_eda(df)

                  * run_classification(df, target)

                  * run_clustering(df)

                     * Return results as dict + generate simple visualizations

Deliverables:
                        * User uploads data, types “show churn predictors,” sees accuracy + feature importances

Week 3 — Visualization & Dashboard Assembly
Goals:
                           * Display results interactively

                           * Add visual components (charts, tables, EDA reports)

Tasks:
                              * Build a dashboard page:

                                 * plotly, matplotlib, or altair visual outputs

                                 * Tabbed results (EDA, model summary, charts)

                                    * Auto-render EDA using ydata-profiling or sweetviz

                                    * Allow the user to requery the same dataset via prompt

Deliverables:
                                       * Query: “What features are correlated with retention?”

                                       * Output: Dashboard with correlation heatmap + summary

Week 4 — User Testing & Polish
Goals:
                                          * Polish UI/UX for demo

                                          * Test with actual PMs or analysts

                                          * Write fallback error handling and prompt improvements

Tasks:
                                             * UX tweaks: loading states, prompt examples, download options

                                             * Add basic logging for feedback (“was this useful?”)

                                             * Collect 3–5 queries per tester

                                             * Iterate based on failure points or confusing outputs

Deliverables:
                                                * End-to-end demo working for 3 example use cases:

                                                   * Churn prediction

                                                   * EDA of feature usage

                                                   * Clustering user cohorts
