DS Auto Insights Focused Implementation Plan (v2)
===================================================

**REVISED APPROACH:** Based on implementation analysis, we're adopting a focused strategy 
to avoid codebase bloat while delivering maximum value. Full implementation would double 
our codebase size (~12K lines), so we're prioritizing high-impact features.

CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT
========================
âœ… **Strong Foundation (6,153 lines, 23 files):**
