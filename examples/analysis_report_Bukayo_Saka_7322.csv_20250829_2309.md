## Analysis Session


### üîç Question 1

The player plays for Arsenal and is named Bukayo Saka, does that make sense from the data?

### üí° Analysis

The dataset includes information about matches involving Arsenal, as seen in the `h_team` and `a_team` columns. However, the dataset preview does not explicitly mention player names, including Bukayo Saka. To confirm if Bukayo Saka is part of the dataset, we would need a column that specifically lists player names or identifiers that can be linked to him. 

If you have additional information or a specific column that might contain player names or identifiers, please let me know so I can assist you further.

### üîç Question 2

Okay well I'm telling you that it's him. For that player, what drives goals?

### üí° Analysis

The correlation analysis reveals several insights into what drives goals for Bukayo Saka:

1. **Non-Penalty Goals (npg)**: There is a very strong correlation between goals and non-penalty goals (0.937). This indicates that most of the goals scored are non-penalty goals.

2. **Expected Goals (xG)**: There is a moderate correlation between goals and expected goals (0.461). This suggests that higher expected goals are associated with more actual goals.

3. **Shots**: There is a moderate correlation between goals and shots (0.346). More shots generally lead to more goals.

4. **Non-Penalty Expected Goals (npxG)**: There is a moderate correlation between goals and non-penalty expected goals (0.368).

5. **xGChain**: There is a moderate correlation between goals and xGChain (0.327), indicating involvement in goal-scoring opportunities.

These factors suggest that Bukayo Saka's goal-scoring is primarily driven by non-penalty goals, expected goals, and the number of shots taken. His involvement in goal-scoring opportunities (xGChain) also plays a role.

### üîç Question 3

Plot a histogram of both xG and xA

### üí° Analysis

Here are the histograms for Expected Goals (xG) and Expected Assists (xA):

### Histogram of Expected Goals (xG)
- **Mean**: 0.19
- **Median**: 0.09
- **Standard Deviation**: 0.24
- **Range**: 0.00 to 1.00

### Histogram of Expected Assists (xA)
- **Mean**: 0.16
- **Median**: 0.07
- **Standard Deviation**: 0.22
- **Range**: 0.00 to 0.98

These histograms provide a visual representation of the distribution of xG and xA values. If you need further analysis or specific insights from these distributions, feel free to ask!

### üîç Question 4

Show me the correlation matrix if this data

### üí° Analysis

Here is the correlation matrix for the dataset, focusing on the relationships between various numeric columns:

### Key Correlations:
- **Goals and Non-Penalty Goals (npg)**: Very strong correlation (0.937)
- **Shots and Expected Goals (xG)**: Strong correlation (0.726)
- **Shots and Non-Penalty Expected Goals (npxG)**: Strong correlation (0.709)
- **Expected Goals (xG) and Non-Penalty Expected Goals (npxG)**: Very strong correlation (0.895)
- **Non-Penalty Expected Goals (npxG) and xGChain**: Strong correlation (0.748)
- **xGChain and xGBuildup**: Strong correlation (0.721)

These correlations suggest that non-penalty goals are a major driver of total goals, and that shots are closely related to expected goals. Additionally, the xGChain and xGBuildup metrics are strongly related, indicating a connection between involvement in goal-scoring opportunities and build-up play.

If you need further analysis or visualizations based on these correlations, feel free to ask!

### üîç Question 5

Give me a scatter plot of xA vs key passes

### üí° Analysis

The scatter plot of Expected Assists (xA) vs Key Passes shows a moderate positive correlation (0.673). This indicates that as the number of key passes increases, the expected assists tend to increase as well. 

If you have any further questions or need additional analysis, feel free to ask!

### üîç Question 6

What are xChain and xBuild up? Do they have any relation to other important metrics like goals?

### üí° Analysis

To understand the relationship of xGChain and xGBuildup with other important metrics like goals, let's look at their definitions and correlations:

### Definitions:
- **xGChain**: This metric measures the total xG (expected goals) of every possession the player is involved in. It reflects a player's involvement in goal-scoring opportunities, regardless of whether they directly assist or score.
  
- **xGBuildup**: This metric measures the xG of possessions where the player is involved, excluding key passes and shots. It reflects a player's involvement in the build-up play leading to goal-scoring opportunities.

### Correlations with Goals:
- **xGChain and Goals**: There is a moderate correlation between xGChain and goals (0.327). This suggests that players involved in goal-scoring opportunities tend to score more goals.
  
- **xGBuildup and Goals**: The correlation between xGBuildup and goals is weaker (0.168), indicating that while build-up play is important, it is less directly related to scoring goals compared to direct involvement in goal-scoring opportunities.

These metrics highlight the importance of a player's involvement in both creating and finishing goal-scoring opportunities. While xGChain is more directly related to goals, xGBuildup reflects a player's contribution to the team's overall play.
